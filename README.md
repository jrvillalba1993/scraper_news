In this assignment I created a web scraper that parsed and sorts data from a sports website and once displayed, allows users to make comments on individual articles.

$ node server
Listening. Visit localhost:3000
Connected to Mongoose!

I used the following modules:
Body-parser
Mongoose
Morgan
Express
Cheerio

# In the late 90s and early 2000s, developers began to explore database options that allowed their web applications to handle unstructured data to meet the growing and ever-changing demands of users and address the limitations of the relational model. While these alternative databases existed for decades prior, they didnâ€™t receive the label NoSQL until this time period.

The structure of a NoSQL database is something other than a table. There are several different types of NoSQL databases, such as key-value and graph. In this unit we will learn MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database. MongoDB documents correspond to a row, or record, in SQL, but unlike rows, documents are analogous to JSON objects. You can see why MongoDB is a popular choice for Node.js developers!

Rather than object-relational mapping, we will implement object-document mapping, or ODM, with Mongoose.js.

Key Topics
NoSQL
MongoDB
Object-document mapping
Mongoose.js
CRUD
Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?
What is object-document mapping?
What is the equivalent of Sequelize associations in Mongoose.js?
Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL
Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB
Explain and execute CRUD methods with MongoDB, using both the and Mongoose.js
Use both a GUI and the Mongo command prompt to interface with a database
Integrate Mongoose in a full-stack web application
Create query builders to populate documents using refs
Homework: All The News That's Fit To Scrape
In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.
